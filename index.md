## About Me

I'm an undergraduate at Grinnell College interested in mathematics and writing. My research and expository writing can be found here, as can my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/files/CV.pdf).

## Research Interests

I am interested in representation stability and its applications to algebra and combinatorics: When complicated invariants associated to families of spaces exhibit stable behavior. More broadly, I am interested in symmetry and---what amounts to the same---canonicity: When must we make a choice (e.g., choose an isomorphism to the dual space), and when is there a natural choice to be made (e.g., the isomorphism to the double-dual)? Moreover, how do these considerations reveal new patterns?
